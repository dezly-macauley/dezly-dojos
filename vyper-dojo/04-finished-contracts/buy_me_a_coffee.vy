# ABOUT: The Purpose of this Vyper smart contract is to do the following:

# 1. Receive funds from users
# 2. Set a minimum amount that users can send
# 3. Allow the owner to withdraw funds

# NOTE: Interfaces and Chainlink price feeds

# An interface lets you use functions from another deployed contract
# This contract let you view the lastest price of Ethereum in USD using
# the Sepolia Testnet.

# `latestAnswer` is the function that lets you do that

    # NOTE: Converting ETH to WEI

    # https://eth-converter.com/
    # In Vyper `msg.value` is given in WEI 
    # 1 ETH = 1 X 10^18 WEI
    # assert msg.value == 1 * (10 ** 18)

    # NOTE: Vyper actually has a convinient method called `as_wei_value`
    # This allows you to convert WEI to ETH

    # assert msg.value >= as_wei_value(1, "ether"),\
    #   "You need to send at least one ETH"

    # NOTE: assert and revert
    # If the user does not meet the requirement, 
    # the transaction will be reverted.
    # This means any actions performed will be reversed and the cost will
    # be paid by the person who made the failed transaction

# SECTION: Function 2 - Withdrawing Funds

    # SUB_SECTION: Step 1 - Get the raw price format 
    # of 1 ETH to USD (8 decimals) from the price feed
    price: int256 = staticcall self.price_feed.latestAnswer()
    # If you go to the contract address and call the `decimals` functions
    # It will show 8 decimals. This means that the last 8 degits of get price
    # decimals
    # https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306#readContract
    # E.g. If latest price = 395576000000
    # That means $3,955.76000000

    # SUB_SECTION: Step 2 - Convert the raw price (8 decimals) to
    # 1 ETH in USD (18 decimal places) 
    eth_price: uint256 = convert(price, uint256) * (10 ** 10)
    # This because 1 ETH = 1 x 10^18 WEI 
    # So you need to add 10 extra decimal places
    # And finally you have to convert the types
    # `convert(price, uint256)` is how you convert a variable 
    # to uint256 in Vyper

    # SUB_SECTION: Step 3 - Use the eth price to convert the ETH amount
    # that was entered into the function
    eth_amount_in_usd: uint256 = (eth_amount * eth_price) // (1 * (10 ** 18))
    return eth_amount_in_usd
    
    # NOTE: staticcall vs extcall

    # use this keyword when you are calling a function that is on
    # another contract, and specifically it is a function that does not 
    # modify the state of the other contract.
    # E.g. latestAnswer() is a view function. Check the interface
    # If you were calling a function that modifies the state of the other
    # contract then you would use the keyword `extcall`
    #return staticcall price_feed.latestAnswer()

#______________________________________________________________________________
# SECTION: Function 4 - Get the price of ETH to USD

# The amount is an int256, and the last 8 numbers are decimals

# SECTION: Function 5 - A function that calls another function
